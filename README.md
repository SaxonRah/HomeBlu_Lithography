#### By: Robert Valentine (previously known as Robert Chubb)

# Abstract
This white paper presents a novel approach to integrated circuit (IC) fabrication leveraging traditional photographic techniques, photon sieve patterns, and Blu-ray laser technology. This method aims to provide a cost-effective and accessible alternative to conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes, enabling hobbyists and researchers to create ICs with high precision.

# Introduction
Integrated circuit (IC) fabrication typically requires expensive and sophisticated equipment, making it inaccessible for small-scale researchers and hobbyists. This paper explores an innovative DIY method using old film cameras, photon sieve patterns, and Blu-ray lasers to achieve IC fabrication. The proposed method focuses on creating high-resolution patterns with cost-effective tools and materials.

# Materials and Methods
## Materials
Old Film Camera: High-resolution film camera for capturing IC patterns.

Photon Sieve Pattern: Large-scale printed IC pattern designed with high precision.

Photographic Film: 35mm film for capturing and developing the IC pattern.

Blu-ray Laser Diode: Blu-ray UV laser diode emitting at 405 nm wavelength.

Laser Driver and Power Supply: Circuitry to power and control the Blu-ray laser.

Optical Components: Lenses, beam splitters, mirrors, and a pinhole for the optical setup.

Photoresist: UV-sensitive photoresist compatible with the 405 nm wavelength.

Silicon Wafers: Standard silicon wafers for substrate.

Spin Coater: Equipment for applying a uniform layer of photoresist.

Development Chemicals: Chemicals for developing the exposed photoresist.

Etching Equipment: Wet chemical etching setup.

Safety Gear: Laser safety goggles rated for 405 nm, protective clothing, and proper ventilation equipment.

## Methods
### Creating the Photon Sieve Pattern:
Design the IC pattern and print it at a large scale suitable for the photon sieve.
Ensure high precision and accuracy in the pattern design.
### Photographing the Pattern:
Use a high-resolution film camera to photograph the large-scale pattern, shrinking it down to a 35mm film size.
Develop the film to obtain a high-contrast negative of the IC pattern.
### Creating the 'IC Lens':
Set up a pinhole LED light source to shine through the developed film negative, creating an 'IC lens' that projects the pattern.
Mount the film negative and pinhole setup stably to maintain pattern integrity.
### Blu-ray Laser Setup:
Install and align the Blu-ray laser diode (405 nm wavelength) with the pinhole setup.
Ensure proper cooling and stable operation of the laser diode.
### Photoresist Coating:
Clean the silicon wafer thoroughly.
Spin-coat a uniform layer of UV-sensitive photoresist on the wafer.
Pre-bake the photoresist if necessary.
### Pattern Exposure:
Expose the photoresist-coated wafer to the projected IC pattern using the Blu-ray laser.
Adjust the exposure time to ensure accurate pattern transfer.
### Photoresist Development:
Develop the photoresist using appropriate chemicals, revealing the pattern.
### Etching Process:
Transfer the pattern to the silicon wafer using wet chemical etching.
Remove any remaining photoresist and clean the wafer.

# Results and Discussion
The proposed method leverages the 405 nm wavelength of Blu-ray lasers to achieve high-resolution patterning. The pinhole setup with the film negative effectively projects the IC pattern onto the photoresist-coated wafer. This innovative combination of traditional photography and modern laser technology provides a cost-effective and accessible approach to IC fabrication.
