**By: Robert Valentine (previously known as Robert Chubb)**

### **Abstract**
This white paper presents a novel approach to integrated circuit (IC) fabrication leveraging traditional photographic techniques, photon sieve patterns, and Blu-ray laser technology. This method aims to provide a cost-effective and accessible alternative to conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes, enabling hobbyists and researchers to create ICs with high precision.

### **Introduction**
Integrated circuit (IC) fabrication typically requires expensive and sophisticated equipment, making it inaccessible for small-scale researchers and hobbyists. This paper explores an innovative DIY method using old film cameras, photon sieve patterns, and Blu-ray lasers to achieve IC fabrication. The proposed method focuses on creating high-resolution patterns with cost-effective tools and materials.

### **Materials and Methods**
**Materials**

- **Old Film Camera**: High-resolution film camera for capturing IC patterns.
- **Photon Sieve Pattern**: Large-scale printed IC pattern designed with high precision.
- **Photographic Film**: 35mm film for capturing and developing the IC pattern.
- **Blu-ray Laser Diode**: Blu-ray UV laser diode emitting at a 405 nm wavelength.
- **Laser Driver and Power Supply**: Circuitry to power and control the Blu-ray laser.
- **Optical Components**: Lenses, mirrors, and mounting equipment for aligning the laser.
- **Photoresist**: UV-sensitive photoresist compatible with the 405 nm wavelength.
- **Silicon Wafers**: Standard silicon wafers for substrate.
- **Spin Coater**: Equipment for applying a uniform layer of photoresist.
- **Development Chemicals**: Chemicals for developing the exposed photoresist.
- **Etching Equipment**: Wet chemical etching setup.
- **Safety Gear**: Laser safety goggles rated for 405 nm, protective clothing, and proper ventilation equipment.

**Methods**

**Creating the Photon Sieve Pattern**:
- **Design the IC Pattern**: Use CAD software to design the IC pattern, ensuring high precision.
- **Printing the Pattern**: Print the IC pattern at a large scale on a high-resolution printer. The pattern should be sharp and accurate, with clear lines and no smudging.

**Photographing the Pattern**:
- **Camera Setup**: Use a high-resolution film camera with a macro lens to photograph the large-scale pattern. Mount the camera on a tripod to ensure stability.
- **Lighting**: Ensure even and bright lighting on the pattern without reflections or glare.
- **Capturing the Image**: Take multiple shots to ensure clarity and focus. Develop the film in a darkroom to obtain a high-contrast negative of the IC pattern.

**Blu-ray Laser Setup**:
- **Laser Diode Installation**: Secure the Blu-ray laser diode (405 nm wavelength) in a stable mount. Ensure proper cooling and use a driver circuit to control the laser’s power output.
- **Film Negative Alignment**: Position the film negative in the laser's path. As the laser shines through the film, it will project the IC pattern onto the photoresist-coated wafer.
- **Optical Alignment**: Use lenses or mirrors as needed to fine-tune the focus and ensure accurate pattern projection.

**Photoresist Coating**:
- **Wafer Preparation**: Clean the silicon wafer using solvents like acetone or isopropyl alcohol. Dry the wafer thoroughly.
- **Spin Coating**: Apply a UV-sensitive photoresist to the wafer using a spin coater. Adjust the spin speed to control the thickness of the photoresist layer. Pre-bake the photoresist if necessary to remove solvents and improve adhesion.

**Pattern Exposure**:
- **Exposure Setup**: Position the photoresist-coated wafer to receive the laser-projected IC pattern.
- **Exposure Time**: Carefully monitor the exposure time to ensure the accurate transfer of the pattern onto the photoresist.

**Photoresist Development**:
- **Chemical Development**: Submerge the exposed wafer in a developer solution appropriate for your photoresist. Monitor the development process under a microscope to avoid over-developing.
- **Rinsing and Drying**: After developing, rinse the wafer with deionized water and dry it in a clean, dust-free environment.

**Etching Process**:
- **Wet Chemical Etching**: Prepare an etchant solution compatible with your wafer’s material. Submerge the wafer in the etchant to dissolve the exposed areas, leaving the photoresist-covered areas intact.
- **Post-Etch Cleaning**: Remove any remaining photoresist and clean the wafer thoroughly to eliminate etchant residues.

### **Results and Discussion**
The proposed method leverages the 405 nm wavelength of Blu-ray lasers to achieve high-resolution patterning. The direct projection of the IC pattern through the film negative provides an effective and simplified approach to transferring designs onto a wafer. This innovative combination of traditional photography and modern laser technology offers a cost-effective and accessible method for IC fabrication.

### **Advantages**
- **Cost-Effective**: Utilizes affordable and readily available materials and equipment.
- **Accessible**: Suitable for small-scale researchers and hobbyists.
- **High Resolution**: The 405 nm wavelength allows for fine detail and precision in patterning.

### **Challenges**
- **Alignment and Stability**: Requires precise alignment of optical components.
- **Safety**: Necessitates strict safety measures for handling lasers and chemicals.
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent results may require iterative adjustments.

### **Conclusion**
This white paper presents a novel and practical approach to DIY IC fabrication using photon sieve patterns, old film cameras, and Blu-ray lasers. With careful attention to detail and safety, this method offers a feasible solution for small-scale semiconductor manufacturing, making advanced technology accessible to a broader audience.

### **Future Work**
Future work will focus on optimizing the alignment process, improving pattern resolution, and exploring additional applications for this DIY fabrication technique. Photon Sieve generation from a IC pattern will require extra research and will be published in a later paper, as it stands there is no Photon Sieve generation, just the raw IC pattern. Collaboration with the DIY and research communities will help refine and expand the capabilities of this innovative approach.
